Hi Fredrik,

in LLRF SW there is a ADC tap delay setting taking place for ch 0 and 1.
I guess we should also set those for remaining channels, but IIRC this is not critical.

Anyway, how do we determine the values?

Hi Hinko,

ADC tap delay, is used to change the time when the FPGA samples the data from
the ADCs, used to avoid sampling at the time when the adc sample is changing value.

The only time you need to set or change this value is if you see that you have
strange values on the sample input, it typically look like you have spurs among
otherwise ok samples. Also if the bad sampling disappears when you lower the
sampling frequency slightly, it could be time to change the tap-delay.

If you need to change tap delay, you start at zero and increase by 1 until
it becomes good and continues increasing by 1 until it becomes bad again,
then you pick the value in the middle.

In your case you put all tap delays to zero and check that you have good samples,
if so, never set the tap-delay.
